operations support; environmental stewardship;\r\n        long-term financial viability; and the health of visitors, staff, and\r\n        the community.\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div>\r\n        The Garden&rsquo;s <a>Master Plan of 2001</a> launched the Sustainable\r\n        Landscapes and Buildings Project. As the name implies, the project is\r\n        much more than buildings. It includes new plants, many of which are\r\n        native species; bioswales to collect stormwater and reduce wear-and-tear\r\n        on New York City&rsquo;s combined sewer system; water recycling systems;\r\n        the new Horticulture/Maintenance Building; the revolutionary Visitor\r\n        &amp; Administration Center; and the transformation of our existing\r\n        parking lot into a 125-space parking garden which began in September\r\n        2008.\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div>On September 27, 2007, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, </div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Borough President Helen Marshall, whose office has been the lead\r\n        supporter of the Sustainable Buildings and Landscape Project, and\r\n        numerous other dignitaries officially opened our Visitor &amp;\r\n        Administration Center, the most advanced green building in New York\r\n        City. It was a landmark event for the Garden as Mayor Bloomberg cited\r\n        the Visitor &amp; Administration Center as a major asset in the\r\n        city&rsquo;s PlaNYC 2030, the ambitious program to cut New York\r\n        City&rsquo;s carbon emissions by 30%.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The new landscapes being installed are functional, meaning the plants\r\n        and soil all play a role in contributing to a healthier habitat. Many of\r\n        the plants in these new landscapes are indigenous to the New York area,\r\n        including those in the Visitor &amp; Administration Building&rsquo;s\r\n        cleansing biotope, constructed wetland, bioswale, and green roof. The\r\n        structure itself is built on the former site of a parking lot,\r\n        maximizing the space for new landscapes and optimizing reuse. In\r\n        addition to highlighting plants that celebrate cultural connections, the\r\n        Garden Master Plan calls for rebuilding some indigenous plant\r\n        communities&mdash; including woodland, savannah, wetland, ridge and\r\n        swale, and prairie ecosystems.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The Garden encourages the establishment and growth of these communities\r\n        by taking steps to revitalize soils, reintroduce native plants and\r\n        seeds, and implementing controlled burns.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        To keep our collections free of unwanted pests and weeds while\r\n        protecting the environment, the Garden uses Integrated Pest Management\r\n        (IPM). This is a systematic approach to managing pests that focuses on\r\n        long-term prevention with minimal impact on human health, the\r\n        environment, and other plants or animals. Using IPM means that the\r\n        Garden can minimize the use of synthetic chemical pesticides and\r\n        fertilizers in our landscapes. The Garden new Plants in Community\r\n        gardens are organized by plant family and feature native plants in a\r\n        garden setting. More than 15 plant families are highlighted in the\r\n        Plants in Community garden around the Visitor &amp; Administration\r\n        Building. These gardens are grouped according to plant families, such as\r\n        Rosaceae (Rose Family), Liliaceae (Lily Family), and Compositae\r\n        (Aster/Daisy/Sunflower Family).\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h1>\r\n        QBG has the opportunity to share with our visitors the critical role\r\n        that plants play both culturally and ecologically in our lives as well\r\n        as the lives of the creatures that share our ecosystems. At the Garden,\r\n        visitors will have the opportunity to experience beautiful and unique\r\n        gardens and habitats that will provide diverse habitat, become a\r\n        functional part of the local hydrology, and offer new opportunities for\r\n        visitors to connect to plants.\r\n      </h1>\r\n      <h1>Benefits:</h1>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Many people have never had the chance to experience healthy native\r\n        habitats that once occupied New York since many have been changed by\r\n        development, pollution, and the introduction of invasive species of\r\n        plants and animals. Over many years, and with proper stewardship\r\n        practices, the Garden&rsquo;s plant communities will showcase the unique\r\n        role that plants play both culturally and ecologically and provide seed\r\n        sources for future rebuilding and restoration of landscapes in and\r\n        around New York.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <hr />\r\n      <p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        Interior surfaces are left largely unfinished, revealing the raw\r\n        building materials such as steel, wood, and concrete. The carpet used in\r\n        selected areas of the Visitor &amp; Administration Building can be\r\n        endlessly recycled into new carpeting. Interior products, such as\r\n        fabrics, sealants, caulks, and paints, contain no or very low levels of\r\n        volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Most wood-based materials are Forest\r\n        Stewardship Council certified. In the Garden&rsquo;s new structures,\r\n        building materials and furnishings incorporate a high percentage of\r\n        recycled content, and over 20% are produced within 500 miles. Over 75%\r\n        of the waste produced during the construction of the Visitor &amp;\r\n        Administration Building has been diverted from the landfill through\r\n        recycling and reuse.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h1>Benefits:</h1>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Using recycled material limits the amount of waste that must be disposed\r\n        of in landfills or incinerators, and reduces the resources used to\r\n        produce new products and material. Purchasing material locally saves\r\n        energy and money on transportation and supports the local economy.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are chemicals found in many common\r\n        products and building materials that can escape into the air and cause\r\n        illness and allergic reactions. By virtually eliminating them from new\r\n        buildings, the Garden will help protect the respiratory health of its\r\n        staff and visitors.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification ensures responsible\r\n        forestry methods were used in the harvesting of timber products.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <hr />\r\n      <h1>Strategies:</h1>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Gray water from the Visitor &amp; Administration Building&rsquo;s sinks,\r\n        dishwashers, and shower is piped to a constructed wetland, while\r\n        rainwater cascades off the terrace roof into a <a>cleansing biotope</a>.\r\n        In both places, water is filtered and treated naturally through\r\n        bacterial activity on the roots of carefully selected plants.

Strategies included the\r\n        elimination of a glass-walled atrium that the Garden had originally\r\n        requested and the creation of a large canopy over the entrance forecourt\r\n        to form a naturally conditioned, outdoor gathering space.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Construction</strong>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The implementation of integrated water systems was complicated by\r\n        existing laws that mandate the separation of construction trades.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Close supervision was important to maintain best practices and comply\r\n        with LEED guidelines.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Operations/Maintenance</strong>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Interpretive touchscreens display information about the building and\r\n        grounds, including real-time energy data.

Sloping away from city streets, remaining runoff is diverted into\r\n        a series of planted depressions, called bioswales, that absorb the vast\r\n        majority of the water. The rest is directed into a native wet meadow\r\n        that mimics local ecosystems that existed in Flushing prior to\r\n        urbanization.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Permeable pavers rest on three tiers of bluestone gravel of increasing\r\n        size, allowing water to penetrate deeply into the soil. The structure\r\n        also facilitates the growth of beneficial oil-eating bacteria that break\r\n        down leaking car fluids and remove them from the environment.{\" \"}\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        {\" \"}\r\n        Additional low-intensity parking areas are stabilized with gravel-grass.\r\n        These flat surfaces are made of large bluestone gravel and seeded with\r\n        native grasses.
