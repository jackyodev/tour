Most people spend 80 to 90 percent of their\r\ntime indoors. Yet studies show that the air inside can be 25 to 62 percent more\r\npolluted than the air outside! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Formaldehyde and other chemicals called volatile organic\r\ncompounds, or VOCs, are one major cause of indoor air pollution. They are found\r\nin many common products, including paints, carpets, plywood, upholstery,\r\npesticides, and household cleaners. They can cause asthma, allergies, and even\r\ncancer. \r\n\r\nThe products used inside our building, such as fabrics, sealants, caulks and\r\npaints, and furniture contain no or very low levels of volatile organic\r\ncompounds (VOCs). By virtually eliminating them from newer projects the Garden\r\nhelps protect the health of its staff and visitors. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Air Quality Protection - Breath Easily!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>During construction, ducts and other parts of a building’s\r\nventilation system may become contaminated, causing health problems for\r\noccupants once the building is completed. A strict Indoor Air Quality\r\nManagement Plan was followed to prevent such contamination. \r\n\r\nThis plan included protection of ductwork and equipment before, during, and\r\nafter installation; limitations on dust-producing work; and a two-week flush\r\nout of the ventilation system at the end of the construction phase.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Smart Lights </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Most lighting systems waste energy. They provide light when\r\nit isn’t needed. Or they provide more light than is necessary. \r\n\r\nOur computer-controlled system automatically adjusts light levels based on how\r\nmuch natural light is available, or whether anyone is in the room. This\r\nefficient system and a building design that lets in daylight help us cut energy\r\nuse by 40 %! As a nation, we use about 25 % of our electricity for lighting. \r\n\r\nYou can save energy at home by switching off lights when you don’t need them\r\nand using compact fluorescent light bulbs.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>This Steel Had a Previous Life!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of the steel used in this building is recycled. \r\n\r\nThe columns inside and outdoors may contain a can of soup you ate, your\r\nneighbor’s old refrigerator, or your parents’ last car.\r\n\r\nRecycling conserves Resources! Recycling one ton of steel saves 2,500 pounds of\r\niron ore and 1,400 pounds of coal. And by recycling, the steel industry saves\r\nenough energy annually to power 18 million homes for a year! Next time you eat\r\na can of fruit or open a can of coffee, be sure to recycle the containers. You\r\nnever know where they will turn up next.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restroom Water Savings</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re saving water in these public restrooms. A sensor\r\nautomatically turns the water on and off when you put your hands under a faucet\r\nand move them away. The urinals in the Men’s Room use no water at all. Also,\r\nour building’s restrooms include no-flow and low-flow plumbing fixtures that\r\nconserve clean water. \r\n\r\nInstead of going to the city’s overburdened sewer system, used water from the\r\nsinks is cleansed by the sand and plants outdoors in our Constructed Wetland,\r\nthen piped back to flush the public toilets.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;\r\n</span>Altogether, we reduced potable water use in our Visitor &amp;\r\nAdministration Center by up to 82 percent! </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Do You Do With a Plant That Can Grow Four Feet a Day? -\r\nBamboo Wall</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Use it as a renewable resource! Have you ever eaten bamboo\r\nshoots? Taken banslochan to treat a cold? Sat on a bamboo chair? If so, you\r\nhave used bamboo, too. \r\n\r\nFor centuries, bamboo has been an important building material in Asia from\r\ndecorative artwork, paper, bicycles, bed linens, clothing, musical instruments,\r\naqueducts, and earthquake-hardy homes are a few unique things made from bamboo.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n  In Chinese bamboo is known as zhu in Korean as dae \"대\" or daenamu 대나무, and in Hindi as baans or venoo. It is a symbol of longevity in China and friendship in India, bamboo holds\r\nsignificant symbolic meanings and is highlighted in the mythology and folklore\r\nof many cultures around the world. \r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <p>The wall rising from our building’s lobby to the second floor is made of reformed\r\nbamboo. There are over 1,000 species of bamboo and people around the world have\r\nrelied on it for food, shelter, and everyday needs throughout history. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBamboo is a renewable resource and when used as a substitute for wood, helps\r\nprotect forests from being destroyed; however, bamboo can also be highly\r\ninvasive and threatening to the native ecosystems.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Urban Heat Island Effect</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dark surfaces, like asphalt, concrete, and tar roofing,\r\nabsorb heat from the sun during the day and slowly release it at night.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>In dense urban areas like New York, this\r\nmakes nighttime temperatures much hotter than in natural areas, especially\r\nduring the summer. The lack of nighttime cooling stresses many different plant and animal species, making it hard for\r\nthem to survive in the city. It also means that air conditioners need to work harder to cool indoor spaces.\r\n\r\nLight-colored surfaces, like the canopy roof and plaza pavers, reflect light,\r\nwhile planted areas like the green roof stay naturally cool due to plant\r\nrespiration. These steps reduce the urban heat island effect around our\r\nbuilding. You can do the same thing around your home by planting a garden and\r\nusing light-colored material on your roof and paved surfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Native Plants and Integrated Pest Management</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing appropriate plants is the most important part of\r\nhaving an environmentally friendly garden. Most of the plants used on and around the new building are native\r\nspecies. This means that they have evolved in this area and are well adapted to\r\nrainfall and temperature conditions.\r\n\r\nTo keep our plants healthy, the Garden uses Integrated Pest Management (IPM).\r\nThis is a systematic approach to managing unwanted weeds and pests without\r\nharming human health or the environment. IPM takes advantage of the biological\r\ncycles of the many interdependent organisms within an ecosystem.\r\n\r\nUsing native plants and IPM means that our new garden collections and\r\nlandscaping need no artificial irrigation and minimal synthetic pesticides and\r\nfertilizers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Green Roof</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Green roofs, also known as vegetated or planted roofs,\r\nprovide habitat for plants, insects, and birds where an empty roof would\r\nusually be. They also reduce stormwater runoff, supply added insulation and\r\nroof protection, and reduce the surrounding air temperature during the\r\nsummer. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThey are built on top of a regular roof in layers. These include a protective\r\nlayer that keeps the green roof from leaking or damaging the roof below, a\r\ndrainage layer that keeps the green roof from becoming waterlogged, and a\r\ngrowing layer with extra lightweight soil for the plant roots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nOur new, 8,000 square-foot green roof has many different native plant species,\r\nsuch as Little Bluestem Grass (Andropogon scoparius) and Prairie Dropseed\r\n(Sporobolus heterolepis). Visitors can walk up the sloping roof to experience\r\nthe landscape firsthand and enjoy a scenic view of the Queens Botanical Garden.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Forest Stewardship Council Certified Wood</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the wood-based materials used in our new building\r\nare Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified. The building’s façade is made\r\nfrom FSC certified Western Red Cedar (Thuja plicata), harvested in the Pacific\r\nNorthwest, where it plays a vital role in native American cultures.\r\n\r\nThe Forest Stewardship Council is an international organization that\r\nestablishes independent standards for wood harvesting and forest management\r\nbased on environmental, economic and social criteria. Using FSC certified wood\r\nhelps protect forest ecosystems and benefits communities that rely on forests.\r\n\r\nAll FSC certified products are stamped with the FSC symbol. Look for this\r\nsymbol when you buy things like plywood, furniture, paper and other wood-based\r\nmaterials.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Constructed Wetland and Graywater Recycling System </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Though it covers a relatively small area, the Constructed\r\nWetland features a variety of wetland plants native to the area. Bottlebrush\r\nSedge (Carex comosa), Great Bulrush (Scirpus validus), Marsh Fern (Thelypteris\r\npalustris) thrive and Cardinal Flower (Lobelia cardinalis) adds a dash of\r\ncolor. This landscape evokes the wetland plant communities that once existed\r\nthroughout the region.\r\n\r\nBut what you can see above ground is only half the story: the Constructed\r\nWetland is also a functional landscape, filling an important role in the\r\nVisitor Administration Building’s water recycling system. \r\nWater that goes down the drain in sinks, showers, dishwashers and most other\r\nsources besides toilets and urinals is called graywater. Usually this water\r\ngoes to the sewer, but in our building, graywater is recycled.\r\n\r\nFirst, gray water is piped out of the building to underground settling tanks,\r\nwhich allows larger debris to sink out of the water. Then it goes to the\r\nConstructed Wetland, where it is slowly released below ground. As the water\r\nseeps through layers of gravel and sand, contaminants are filtered out. Once it\r\nreaches the root zones of the wetland plants, organic nutrients, metals, and\r\nother contaminants are naturally treated and absorbed by the plants.\r\n\r\nAfter moving through the Constructed Wetland, the cleaned water is collected\r\nand piped back into the Visitor Administration Building, where it is used\r\nto flush toilets. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Constructed Wetland can clean and recycle up to 4,000 gallons of water a\r\nweek. This saves more fresh water in a week than a typical person drinks in\r\ntwenty years! It also prevents water pollution by reducing the amount of water that enters New York City’s\r\noverburdened sewer system.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Geothermal System</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Buildings use more energy for heating and air conditioning\r\nthan anything else. To save energy, the Visitor\r\n&amp; Administration Building’s Geothermal System taps the heat of the earth to\r\nprovide heating and cooling for the building and eliminates the need to burn\r\nany fossil fuels on-site.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Geothermal System uses 75% less energy than regular\r\nheating and air conditioning, saving about as much energy as it takes to light\r\nthe Statue of Liberty!\r\n\r\n1. Water from an aquifer 300 feet underground is pumped into the building from\r\na well near the building. Because it is buried so deep, this water remains\r\napproximately 55 degrees F year-round. The amount of water pumped adjusts automatically based on the current\r\nheating or cooling needs of the building.\r\n\r\n2. The water is then piped into the building’s mechanical room.\r\n\r\n3. In the building’s mechanical room, the well water flows through coils of\r\npipe within pieces of equipment called heat exchangers.\r\nAt the same time, other coils of pipe carry\r\nwater from the building’s heating and cooling system through the same heat\r\nexchangers. During the winter, the exchangers transfer heat energy from the\r\nwell water into the system water, heating it to 115 degrees Fahrenheit. During the summer, heat energy is transferred\r\nfrom the system water to the well water, leaving the system water 45 degrees\r\nFahrenheit.\r\n\r\n4. After the transfer, the well water is pumped back into the underground\r\naquifer.\r\n\r\n5. The heated or cooled water is piped to ventilation equipment throughout the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n6. The building’s ventilation equipment uses the heated or cooled water to heat\r\nor cool fresh air.\r\n\r\n7.This air is blown through vents into the building’s occupied areas, heating and cooling these spaces. The rate and temperature of this air is\r\nautomatically adjusted based on the temperature and quality of air in each\r\ndifferent part of the building.\r\n\r\n8. The water used in the heating and cooling system is cycled back to the heat\r\nexchangers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Construction Waste Management</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Over 75% of the waste produced during the construction of\r\nthe Visitor &amp; Administration Building was diverted from the landfill\r\nthrough recycling and reuse.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Solar Panels</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Solar panels use the photovoltaic process to capture the\r\nsun’s energy and covert it into electricity.\r\n\r\nA solar array is made up of a group of solar panels, often called modules.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Our building has an array of 78 modules on\r\nthe roof. Each module is made of many individual photovoltaic cells.\r\n\r\nThe photovoltaic cells are made of two separate layers of material, which is\r\nmostly silicon.The two layers are\r\nconnected by a wire.\r\n\r\nWhen sunlight strikes the surface of the cell, it frees electrons in the top\r\nlayer of the cell and they begin to move through the wire to the bottom\r\nlayer. The more intense the sunlight, the more electrons will be freed and the more rapidly they will move through\r\nthe wire. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Inverter</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The inverter converts direct current (DC) electricity from\r\nthe array into alternating current (AC) electricity. Most electrical devices\r\nlike lights, and computers, use AC electricity.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Electric Meter</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The electric meter measures electrical energy produced by\r\nthe solar panels. Electrical energy is measured in kilowatt-hours.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Our solar panels can produce up to 16\r\nkilowatt-hours in an hour.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>They produce\r\nmore electricity when the sun is shining more intensely. - Irradiance is the\r\namount of electromagnetic energy (solar radiation) falling on a surface over a\r\nspecific time and is<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>most efficient when\r\nthere is uniform light coverage of the photovoltaic (PV) arrays.\r\n\r\nElectricity generated by the solar energy system, combined with electricity\r\nfrom the electric utility company, is routed to the building.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>The more electricity generated by the solar\r\nenergy system, the less electricity needs to be brought into the building from\r\nthe electric utility.\r\n\r\nCoverage will be affected by the angle of direct and indirect sunlight falling\r\non the arrays, which changes throughout the year and because of season.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Recycled and Recyclable Materials</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Using recycled material limits the amount of waste that must\r\nbe disposed of in landfills or incinerators, and reduces the resources used to\r\nproduce new products and material.\r\n\r\nIn the Visitor &amp; Administration Building, office materials and furnishings\r\nincorporate a high percentage of recycled content, and many can be recycled at\r\nthe end of their useful life. For example, the carpeting used in some offices\r\nis a cradle-to-cradle certified product, meaning it can be continually recycled\r\ninto new carpeting with very little waste. \r\n\r\nThe carpet also contains very low levels of volatile organic compounds, which\r\nhelps protect the health of staff members.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Efficient Lighting System</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The building uses a Digital Addressable Lighting Interface\r\n(DALI) system to control the building’s artificial lights.\r\n\r\nThis means that light levels are automatically adjusted in each area based on\r\navailable natural light and presence of occupants.\r\n\r\nUsing this efficient DALI system and a building design that brings in abundant\r\nnatural light will help us use 40% less energy for artificial lighting, each\r\nyear saving enough electricity to light the top of the Empire State Building\r\nfor three days straight.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Efficient Ventilation System</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Ventilation system in the building designed to maximize the comfort of occupants\r\nwhile using as little energy as possible. \r\n\r\nOur building’s operable windows are well placed to provide natural ventilation\r\nduring good weather, reducing the workload of the ventilation system. Numerous\r\nthermostats and CO2 sensors monitor occupied areas and automatically control\r\nthe ventilation system.\r\n\r\nAir is added to each area of the building at just the right rate and\r\ntemperature to ensure good air quality and the comfort of visitors and staff.\r\nThe ventilation system uses the building’s geothermal system to produce heated\r\nand cooled air.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Natural Lighting and Ventilation - These Windows Save\r\nEnergy! </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultures around the world have traditionally made shelters\r\nand buildings that work with nature, through appropriate siting, carefully\r\nsized and placed openings, and features like the brise soleil, to provide\r\ncomfortable and healthy living and working spaces. \r\n\r\nThe long, narrow architecture allow 90% of the interior space to receive\r\ndaylight and maximize natural ventilation. The large windows allow our visitors\r\nand staff members to enjoy views of the Garden and reduce the need for\r\nelectrical lighting. \r\n\r\nOperable windows allow fresh air to enter the building. In the administrative\r\noffices, floor to ceiling windows are screened by a wooden brise soleil that\r\npermits light and heat during the winter and shades the interior in the summer.\r\nIt enable staff and visitors to enjoy beautiful garden views. They let daylight\r\nin, reducing the need for artificial lighting. Some can be opened for fresh\r\nair. Their glass has an invisible metallic layer called a low-E coating that\r\nkeeps heat inside in winter and keeps out the sun’s hot rays in summer.\r\n\r\nMost heat gain and loss through windows can account for 50 % of the energy used\r\nto heat and cool a house.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Energy Star Appliances</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy Star certified appliances in the office are purchased\r\nfor their efficiency. To earn the Energy Star, products must meet strict energy\r\nefficiency criteria set by the US Environmental Protection Agency or the US\r\nDepartment of Energy. \r\n\r\nFor example, Energy Star refrigerators, like those used in our building, are at\r\nleast 15% more efficient than the minimum federal efficiency standard. Buying\r\nappliances with the Energy Star label saves energy and money.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Waste Human Waste? - Composting Toilets</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The restrooms on our building’s second floor are composting\r\ntoilets, which require very little water and prevent water pollution by keeping\r\nwaste out of the sewer system.\r\n\r\nMild, biodegradable soap and water carry the waste to a composting tank below.\r\nThere, bacteria, fungi, and earthworms turn it into compost, just as in a\r\ncompost pile. The resulting compost looks and smells like topsoil. The toilet\r\nuses only 3 to 6 ounces of recycled water for flushing. Compare this to the\r\ntypical toilet, which uses 1.6 gallons! And no water or waste goes into the\r\ncity’s overburdened sewage system.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Sustainable Siting</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Visitor &amp; Administration Building is built on the\r\nsite of the Garden’s former parking lot. Putting our building here protects\r\nexisting green space and maximizes space for new landscapes. It is located\r\nclose to public transportation, allowing staff and visitors to travel to the\r\nGarden with less environmental impact.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Sun Shade (Brise Soleil)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The horizontal strips of wood over the windows are called\r\nbrise soleil, which means “sun break” in French. Our building’s distinctive\r\nbrise soleil lets sunlight and heat into interior offices during winter and\r\nshades them in the summer. This saves energy in lighting, heating and cooling.\r\n\r\nThe brise soleil is made of Forest Stewardship Council certified wood that was\r\nharvested and milled locally. The species of wood used is Black Locust (Robinia\r\npseudoacacia), a common domestic hardwood. Over 20% of the materials used in\r\nthe building have been harvested or manufactured within 500 miles. Using local\r\nmaterial saves energy and money on transportation and supports the local\r\neconomy.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>\r\n\r\nA brise soleil is one type of sun-shading device but many design elements used\r\nto screen the sun appear in Islamic, Japanese and Caribbean architectural\r\ntraditions, among others. For example, sudare are blinds or screens made out of\r\nslats of decorative wood or bamboo in many Japanese homes.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Bioswale </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When it rains, water from surrounding areas and overflow\r\nfrom the Cleansing Biotope runs into this bioswale.\r\n\r\nA bioswale is a low-lying area planted with vegetation that can tolerate wet\r\nand dry conditions. Water flows into a special soil that maximizes retention.\r\nIt then evaporates, is absorbed by plants, and allowed to filter back into the\r\nwater table. Some of the plant species in the Garden’s bioswales include Great\r\nBlue Lobelia (Lobelia siphilitica) and Shallow Sedge (Carex lurida).\r\n\r\nBioswales are one of the Garden’s most important stormwater management tools.\r\nThey prevent water pollution by keeping stormwater out of New York City’s\r\ncombined wastewater system, where it often mixes with raw sewage before being\r\nreleased into area waterways.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Cleansing Biotope</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cleansing Biotope is an area planted with selected\r\nnative wetland species such as Soft Rush (Juncus effusus) and Lizard’s Tail\r\n(Saururus cernuus).\r\n\r\nDuring a storm, rainwater runs off the terrace canopy into the Cleansing\r\nBiotope. The water filters into the soil and through the root zones of the\r\nwetland plants, where organic nutrients, metals and other contaminants are\r\nnaturally treated and absorbed by the plants.\r\n\r\nAfter it is cleaned, the water is piped underground to splash out of the Entry\r\nPlaza fountain. Then it flows alongside the Visitor &amp; Administration\r\nBuilding back to the Cleansing Biotope to begin the cycle again.\r\n\r\nRecycling rainwater conserves fresh water and helps prevent water pollution in\r\nthe area’s waterways.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Extra Insulation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Visitor Administration Building’s exterior walls\r\nhave thicker insulation (over eight inches in many places) than in most\r\nbuildings. This reduces the energy needed to heat and cool the building and\r\nkeeps the occupants comfortable in all weather. \r\n\r\nThe insulation used in our building is made of up to 85% post-consumer recycled\r\nmaterial and contains low levels of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Plants in Community </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Plants have families too. Our new Plants in Community gardens\r\nare organized by plant family and feature native plants in a garden setting.\r\nMore than 15 plant families are highlighted in the Plants in Community gardens\r\naround the Visitor Administration Building. These gardens are grouped\r\naccording to plant family, such as Rosaceae (Rose family), Liliaceae (Lily\r\nfamily) and Compositae (Aster/Daisy/Sunflower family).</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n      </>\r\n   );\r\n  };\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  "]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
