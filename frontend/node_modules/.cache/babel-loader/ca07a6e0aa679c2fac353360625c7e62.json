const sustainabilityRender = (state) => {\r\n    return (\r\n      <>\r\n       <div>Queens Botanical Garden teaches and practices sustainability in design, construction, and operations support; environmental stewardship; long-term financial viability; and the health of visitors, staff, and the community.</div>\r\n<div>The Garden&rsquo;s  <a>Master Plan of 2001</a>  launched the Sustainable Landscapes and Buildings Project. As the name implies, the project is much more than buildings. It includes new plants, many of which are native species; bioswales to collect stormwater and reduce wear-and-tear on New York City&rsquo;s combined sewer system; water recycling systems; the new Horticulture/Maintenance Building; the revolutionary Visitor &amp; Administration Center; and the transformation of our existing parking lot into a 125-space parking garden which began  in September  2008.</div>\r\n<div>On September 27, 2007, Mayor Michael Bloomberg,  </div>\r\n<p>Borough President Helen Marshall, whose office has been the lead supporter of the Sustainable Buildings and Landscape Project, and numerous other dignitaries  officially opened our Visitor &amp; Administration Center, the most advanced green building in New York City. It was a landmark event for the Garden as Mayor Bloomberg cited the Visitor &amp; Administration Center as a major asset in the city&rsquo;s PlaNYC 2030, the ambitious program to cut New York City&rsquo;s carbon emissions by 30%.</p>\r\n<p>The new landscapes being installed are functional, meaning the plants and soil all play a role in contributing to a healthier habitat. Many of the plants in these new landscapes are indigenous to the New York area, including those in the Visitor &amp; Administration Building&rsquo;s cleansing biotope, constructed wetland, bioswale, and green roof. The structure itself is built on the former site of a parking lot, maximizing the space for new landscapes and optimizing reuse. In addition to highlighting plants that celebrate cultural connections, the Garden Master Plan calls for rebuilding some indigenous plant communities&mdash; including woodland, savannah, wetland, ridge and swale, and prairie ecosystems.</p>\r\n<p>The Garden encourages the establishment and growth of these communities by taking steps to revitalize soils, reintroduce native plants and seeds, and implementing controlled burns.</p>\r\n<p><br />To keep our collections free of unwanted pests and weeds while protecting the environment, the Garden uses Integrated Pest Management (IPM). This is a systematic approach to managing pests that focuses on long-term prevention with minimal impact on human health, the environment, and other plants or animals. Using IPM means that the Garden can minimize the use of synthetic chemical pesticides and fertilizers in our landscapes. The Garden new Plants in Community gardens are organized by plant family and feature native plants in a garden setting. More than 15 plant families are highlighted in the Plants in Community garden around the Visitor &amp; Administration Building. These gardens are grouped according to plant families, such as Rosaceae (Rose Family), Liliaceae (Lily Family), and Compositae (Aster/Daisy/Sunflower Family).</p>\r\n<h1>QBG has the opportunity to share with our visitors the critical role that plants play both culturally and ecologically in our lives as well as the lives of the creatures that share our ecosystems. At the Garden, visitors will have the opportunity to experience beautiful and unique gardens and habitats that will provide diverse habitat, become a functional part of the local hydrology, and offer new opportunities for visitors to connect to plants.</h1>\r\n<h1>Benefits:</h1>\r\n<p>Many people have never had the chance to experience healthy native habitats that once occupied New York since many have been changed by development, pollution, and the introduction of invasive species of plants and animals. Over many years, and with proper stewardship practices, the Garden&rsquo;s plant communities will showcase the unique role that plants play both culturally and ecologically and provide seed sources for future rebuilding and restoration of landscapes in and around New York.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><br />Interior surfaces are left largely unfinished, revealing the raw building materials such as steel, wood, and concrete. The carpet used in selected areas of the Visitor &amp; Administration Building can be endlessly recycled into new carpeting. Interior products, such as fabrics, sealants, caulks, and paints, contain no or very low levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Most wood-based materials are  Forest Stewardship Council certified. In the Garden&rsquo;s new structures, building materials and furnishings incorporate a high percentage of recycled content, and over 20% are produced within 500 miles.  Over 75% of the waste produced during the construction of the Visitor &amp; Administration Building has been diverted from the landfill through recycling and reuse.</p>\r\n<h1>Benefits:</h1>\r\n<p>Using recycled material limits the amount of waste that must be disposed of in landfills or incinerators, and reduces the resources used to produce new products and material. Purchasing material locally saves energy and money on transportation and supports the local economy.</p>\r\n<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are chemicals found in many common products and building materials that can escape into the air and cause illness and allergic reactions. By virtually eliminating them from new buildings, the Garden will help protect the respiratory health of its staff and visitors.</p>\r\n<p>Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification ensures responsible forestry methods were used in the harvesting of timber products.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1>Strategies:</h1>\r\n<p>Gray water from the Visitor &amp; Administration Building&rsquo;s sinks, dishwashers, and shower is piped to a  constructed wetland, while rainwater cascades off the terrace roof into a  <a>cleansing biotope</a>. In both places, water is filtered and treated naturally through bacterial activity on the roots of carefully selected plants. The treated gray water is returned to the building for use in toilet flushing, while the cleansed rainwater supplies a meandering water feature and fountain. Low maintenance, drought-resistant plants are used in Garden landscapes to reduce the need for irrigation. Throughout the project, rainwater is filtered and absorbed into the soil through  <a>bioswales</a> instead of entering the city&rsquo;s combined sewer, reducing pollution in Long Island Sound.</p>\r\n<p><a>A green roof planted</a>  with mostly native plant species absorbs rainwater that falls on the Visitor &amp; Administration Building auditorium.  Rainwater that falls on the Horticulture/Maintenance Building is collected and stored in an underground cistern. A piping system connects this cistern to the building&rsquo;s storage and garage space, where the water is used to wash vehicles and tools.</p>\r\n<h1>Benefits:</h1>\r\n<p>Conserving fresh water and recycling water to use in place of freshwater reduces the burden on the city&rsquo;s water supply system and vulnerability to drought.</p>\r\n<p>Collecting, storing, and recycling gray water and rainwater onsite diverts it from the city&rsquo;s costly, energy-intensive wastewater treatment process. These strategies also prevent the release of polluted water into local waterways during large storms, when the city&rsquo;s wastewater treatment system is overwhelmed.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1>Strategies:</h1>\r\n<p><br />In the Horticulture/Maintenance Building, translucent siding allows daylight to reach interior workspaces, reducing the need for electrical lighting.<br /> The Visitor &amp; Administration Building&rsquo;s orientation and long, narrow architecture allow 90% of the interior space to receive daylight and maximize natural ventilation. A  <a>geothermal system</a>  uses the earth&rsquo;s constant temperature to provide seasonal heating and cooling. Rooftop  <a>photovoltaic cells</a>  transform sunlight into electricity to operate high-efficiency ventilation and lighting systems.</p>\r\n<h1>Benefits:</h1>\r\n<p>Overall, the Visitor &amp; Administration Building will use approximately 40% less energy from nonrenewable sources than a typical building of its size. Every year this will prevent the release of over forty tons of the greenhouse gas CO2 into the atmosphere, the equivalent of removing nine cars from the road. Annual energy costs will be reduced by over $7,000, a savings passed on to New York City taxpayers.</p>\r\n<p>  The Queens Botanical Garden is located on 39 acres of land owned by New York City, the legacy of the 1939 and 1964 World's Fairs. It is open to the public, and admission is free.</p>\r\n<p>The Visitor and Administration Center includes a reception area, an auditorium, a garden store, gallery space, meeting rooms, administrative offices, and a mechanical room. The project is made up of three interconnected spaces: a forecourt and roof canopy, a linear central reception and administration building clad in wood and glass, and an auditorium space tucked into the landscape, sheltered by a sloping green roof.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Environmental Aspects</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The Visitor and Administration Center was designed to celebrate the relationship between diverse cultures and the environment and to showcase water management, landscape integration, and energy conservation and generation. The Queens Botanical Garden is accessible by public transportation, and showers and changing areas encourage employees to bike or walk.</p>\r\n<p>Reusing graywater for flushing toilets reduces the project's potable water consumption by 55%. The building also features waterless urinals and composting toilets. Thanks to extensive bioswales and a green roof on the auditorium, the project manages all stormwater on site. A water channel, fed by rainwater that cascades off the roof canopy, weaves around the building and through the gardens.</p>\r\n<p>The reception building's long, narrow shape is oriented along an east-west axis, allowing daylight to penetrate all interior spaces. An efficient lighting system, daylight dimming, and occupancy sensors reduce energy consumption. Glass doors and windows open in temperate weather, providing natural ventilation. The building uses photovoltaic panels and a ground-source heat-pump system to harvest energy on-site.</p>\r\n<p>More than 33% of the materials in the building, by cost, were harvested or manufactured within 500 miles of the project site. The project team also preferred materials with high durability, low maintenance requirements, recycled content, low chemical emissions, and Forest Stewardship Council certification.</p>\r\n<p>The now-reclaimed land on which the Queens Botanical Garden is located was famously described in F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 book The Great Gatsby as \"a valley of ashes.\"  </p>\r\n<div>  Today, the Garden is located at the nexus of the most ethnically diverse county in the United States. More than 130 languages and dialects are spoken in the area.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Community-based programming includes gardening for children and seniors, seasonal celebrations, weddings, daily tai chi practice, and classes for visitors and professionals on everything from renewable energy to green landscaping and composting. The building design is the result of a community-driven planning process. A variety of assembly spaces within the Center, both open to the landscape and sheltered from the elements, shape visitors' experience of the Gardens.  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The Garden is accessible by public transportation. Showers located in the building encourage employees to commute by biking or walking. Parking options include designated spaces for carpools and alternative-fuel vehicles. The Garden is also converting its own vehicle fleet to electric vehicles.</p>\r\n<h3>Green Strategies</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Property Evaluation\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Assess property for integration with the local community and regional transportation corridors</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Responsible Planning\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ensure that development fits within a responsible local and regional planning framework</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Properties with Excessive Impacts\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Avoid contributing to sprawl</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Support for Appropriate Transportation\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Provide showers and changing areas for bicycle and pedestrian commuters</li>\r\n<li>Provide storage area for bicycles</li>\r\n<li>Provide access to public transportation</li>\r\n<li>Provide vehicle access to support car and vanpooling</li>\r\n<li>Provide for electric vehicle charging</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Property Selection Opportunities\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Select already-developed sites for new development</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The project team sited the building to be subservient to the gardens and to reinforce the urban character of the perimeter streets, like a garden wall.</p>\r\n<p>  The building is nestled among mature trees on the <strong>site of a former parking lot</strong>.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The flood-prone site, which once included a creek, has been filled and excavated a number of times, and the existing soil had no original structure remaining. All grounds not designated for intensive use were planted with native species, reinvigorating the depleted soils. The construction team took care during grading to preserve the extensive root zones.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>The community-driven planning process emphasized the importance of <strong>water as a resource vital to all cultures</strong>. As a result, the project team used water to unify the building and the landscape. Through the use of water, the team hoped to recall the creek that once ran through the site and to inspire new thinking about water conservation and living landscapes.</p>\r\n<p>During rainy days, <strong>water cascades off of the sheltering canopy roof and into a channel flowing between the main building and the auditorium</strong>. The captured rainwater moves through biotope pools filled with gravel and native wetland species that cleanse the rainwater before it is piped underground. The water then emerges at the entry plaza fountain, moves through the landscape via a meandering stream, and returns to the biotope to begin the cycle anew. The water levels vary in response to the weather and season.</p>\r\n<p>The landscape manages all precipitation on site. Planted bioswales throughout the gardens collect rainwater that falls on the site, and rainwater that falls on the auditorium's green roof sustains the roof's plantings.</p>\r\n<p>The Center is composed of three interconnected spaces: <strong>the forecourt</strong> and <strong>roof canopy</strong>, the linear reception and administration building, and the auditorium, which is sheltered by a sloping green roof. Each part of the structure reduces energy use through the use of passive design strategies tailored to the local climate.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The dramatic roof canopy provides a basic shelter that emulates the adjacent alley of mature oaks. The top surface of the canopy is covered with a reflective material, reducing solar heat gain and minimizing the project's contribution to the urban heat-island effect. The long and narrow shape of the central reception building allows daylight to penetrate all interior spaces.</p>\r\n<div>A wooden brise-soleil wraps the western and southern walls of the building to reduce unwanted heat gain and glare. On temperate days, glass doors and windows slide open to provide cross ventilation.</div>\r\n<div>  The semi-intensive green roof of the auditorium, planted with native species, provides thermal insulation as well as acoustical insulation from the flight path overhead. Skylights and a long window with a frogs-eye view of the water channel bring light into this partially underground space.</div>\r\n<p>On temperate days, sliding glass doors and windows on the main building can be opened in all occupied spaces, connecting the building's occupants directly to the gardens. The narrow footprint and open-plan reception and workspaces allow diffuse light, filtered through the brise-soleil, to penetrate the interior.</p>\r\n<p>  </p>\r\n<p>The project is well insulated through conventional insulation as well as the auditorium's green roof, contributing to a thermally consistent, quiet, and comfortable indoor environment. The lighting system responds to occupancy and daylight levels, providing a visually pleasing environment while reducing energy use.</p>\r\n<p>The project team left the structure and systems exposed whenever possible; where paints, finishes, and carpeting were used, the team selected products with low chemical emissions.  </p>\r\n<p>The team also followed a construction indoor air quality plan that ensured separate ventilation to contain construction dust and required a two-week building flush-out with 100% outside air.</p>\r\n<h1>Metrics</h1>\r\n<p>Daylighting at levels that allow lights to be off during daylight hours around 84%.</p>\r\n<p>A greywater system that is separate from the stormwater system uses an adjacent wetland to cleanse and repurpose building water for flushing toilets, reducing the project's potable water consumption by 55%. The project also features waterless urinals and composting toilets.  </p>\r\n<p>The project goal was to not only generate energy to meet building needs, but to teach visitors about the passive design principles and technological strategies employed. The new building creates energy by harvesting nature and reduces energy use by design.</p>\r\n<p>Overall the new Visitor and Administration Center will realize a 40.5% cost savings compared to a typical building of its size.  A geothermal heat exchange system uses the earth's constant temperature to reduce nonrenewable energy use. Atop the roof of the main building, integrated photovoltaic panels provide 17.5% of the complex's electricity needs.</p>\r\n<p>The narrow building is east-west oriented and designed to encourage natural ventilation and daylighting. 84% of interior spaces receive daylight and all occupied rooms feature operable windows. The brise-soleil is designed to provide thermal comfort, consistent light levels and full views of the surrounding garden.    </p>\r\n<p>  </p>\r\n<p>A DALI lighting system, daylight dimming and motion detection reduces energy consumption. The building is well insulated, and the green roof atop the auditorium further enhances the insulation value.</p>\r\n<p>More than 33% of the materials in the building, by cost, were harvested or manufactured within 500 miles of the project site. Locally salvaged hemlock was used for the concrete formwork, and black locust certified to Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards was used for the bridges, outdoor benches, and brise-soleil. The building siding is FSC-certified western red cedar.    </p>\r\n<p>The wallboard, tile, carpet, office systems, and bathroom partitions all contain recycled content, and the concrete used for cast-in-place and architectural applications includes blast furnace slag and recycled steel reinforcing.</p>\r\n<p>The project team also selected materials to improve indoor environmental quality. The colors of exterior surfaces were selected to reflect light, cooling interior spaces. A wooden brise-soleil and low-emissivity glass wrap the western and southern walls of the building, deflecting harsh sun and blocking ultraviolet rays. All interior finishes contain low or no volatile organic compounds.</p>\r\n<p>The Queens Botanical Garden has implemented a comprehensive recycling and waste-reduction program.</p>\r\n<p>The project team relied on concrete, steel, and glass for much of the project's structure in order to enhance durability and reduce maintenance requirements. The team also used finish materials sparingly, exposing the character of those materials. The green roof covering the auditorium space, solar-reflecting waterproofing material on the canopy, and brise-soleil shield the building from sun and water damage.   Many of the finish materials, including the carpet and office systems, are modular and recyclable. The project's open office plan and variety of gathering spaces enhance programming flexibility. Major building systems were left exposed for ease of future upgrades.</p>\r\n<p>  </p>\r\n<p>The borough of Queens is fast becoming a hub for ecological innovation, and the Queens Botanical Garden Visitor Center has influenced administration and policy throughout the city, including through a new local law that mandates LEED certification for all new City-funded construction. Mayor Michael Bloomberg opened the Center, praising it as a prototype for future buildings and an important asset in the development of PlaNYC 2030, the City program for implementing green practices and reducing carbon emissions 30% by the year 2030.  </p>\r\n<p>There were challenges during the building process. As the first project in the city designed to attain a LEED Platinum rating, the team was largely inexperienced. We were guided by consultants and used the construction of a maintenance building for the Garden as a practice project. New York State's &ldquo;Wick&rsquo;s Law&rdquo; necessitated the separation of construction trades, but the design of the building systems was heavily integrated. Careful documentation of responsibility was essential. Contractors with good construction standards easily adjusted to the necessary erosion control, tree protection, and indoor air quality inspections.</p>\r\n<p>  We learned that green design involves rethinking the way we design buildings and manage construction processes. Green design influenced the form of the whole building and was a driving force behind our design. If architecture is to play a leading role in the creation of a sustainable culture, it must inspire communities to connect more profoundly with the natural world.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cost and Payback Analysis: </strong></p>\r\n<p>Environmental responsibility was not the civic priority it is today when the Garden began a capital campaign to fund the project ten years ago. New York City stepped forward to support the initiative, and the project became a model for civic structures when it was selected as a pilot project for New York City's High-Performance Green Buildings Initiative.</p>\r\n<p>Through the New York City Office of Sustainable Design and Construction, the project received grants from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) that funded energy efficiency testing, energy modeling, geothermal testing, and photovoltaic systems.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Financing Mechanisms</strong></p>\r\n<p>Grant: Public agency</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cost Data</strong></p>\r\n<p>Cost data in U.S. dollars as of date of completion.</p>\r\n<p>Total project cost (land excluded): $12,000,000</p>\r\n<p><strong>Process and Results: </strong></p>\r\n<p>Predesign</p>\r\n<p>The Queens Botanical Garden was committed to a comprehensive greening initiative from the start.</p>\r\n<p>The predesign process involved community members representing different cultures who collectively promoted environmental stewardship. The design team involved children and adults from the community in design workshops.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Design</strong></p>\r\n<p>Preprogramming during design development reduced the enclosed, conditioned area of the building by one-third. Strategies included the elimination of a glass-walled atrium that the Garden had originally requested and the creation of a large canopy over the entrance forecourt to form a naturally conditioned, outdoor gathering space.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>\r\n<p>The implementation of integrated water systems was complicated by existing laws that mandate the separation of construction trades.</p>\r\n<p>Close supervision was important to maintain best practices and comply with LEED guidelines.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Operations/Maintenance</strong></p>\r\n<p>Interpretive touchscreens display information about the building and grounds, including real-time energy data. The information on the touchscreens and signage has been translated into four languages.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Post-Occupancy</strong></p>\r\n<p>A grant-funded monitoring project will track the air temperature, plant surface temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, and soil temperature on the auditorium's green roof. The data will be provided to researchers and displayed on in-house interpretive touchscreens, which are available to all visitors. Additional data collection, including water sampling and video monitoring, may be added in the future.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rating System: </strong></p>\r\n<p>U.S. Green Building Council LEED-NC, v.2/v.2.1</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rating Date: </strong></p>\r\n<p>2008</p>\r\n<p>Score or Rating Result:</p>\r\n<p>Platinum (52 points)</p>\r\n<p><strong>Primary Submission Contact: </strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Susan Lacerte<br /> Project Architect (if different from submission contact):</li>\r\n<li>Joan Krevlin<br /> BKSK Architects, LLP<br /> http://www.bkskarch.com</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Project Team: </strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Owner/developer (Assistant director, director of capital projects) Jennifer Ward-Souder Queens Botanical Garden Flushing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Owner/developer (Operations and project manager) Peter Sansone Queens Botanical Garden Flushing, NY</li>\r\n<li>Architect Julia Nelson BKSK Architects, LLP New York, NY</li>\r\n<li>Architect Diane Alexander BKSK Architects, LLP New York, NY</li>\r\n<li>Architect Dirk Hartmann BKSK Architects, LLP New York, NY</li>\r\n<li>Architect Keith Pitocchi BKSK Architects, LLP New York, NY</li>\r\n<li>Architect Gerry Smith BKSK Architects, LLP New York, NY</li>\r\n<li>Landscape architect Atelier Dreiseitl Atelier Dreiseitl Waterscapes Uberlingen, Germany</li>\r\n<li>Landscape architect David Yocca Conservation Design Forum Elmhurst, IL</li>\r\n<li>Environmental building consultant Geoff Hurst Viridian Energy &amp; Environmental, LLC New York, NY</li>\r\n<li>Structural and civil engineer Tian Fang Jing Weidlinger Associates, Inc.

It include 6 ADA compliant spaces, 92 standard spaces and 19 overflow spaces (composed of grass grown in a gravel medium) for 117 total spaces. These new landscapes all contribute to QBG&rsquo;s efforts to foster environmental stewardship and enhance the visitor experience.</p>\r\n<p>  Queens Botanical Garden&rsquo;s Parking Garden is another innovative component of the Sustainable Landscapes and Buildings Project, furthering the environmental vision outlined in our Master Plan.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Demonstrating a more environmentally-sensitive method of managing stormwater onsite, the Parking Garden will help keep our city&rsquo;s rivers and bays clean by easing the burden on the city&rsquo;s sewer system, while offering visitors comfortable and inspiring gardens. Like other features of QBG, the Parking Garden showcases sustainable practices in design, construction, and operations to protect the health of the environment, community, and future generations.</p>\r\n<p>The Parking Garden and Sustainable Landscapes and Buildings Project were made possible by a dedicated team of professionals from Queens Botanical Garden, city agencies, consultants and contractors. Queens Botanical Garden is thankful for Leadership Support and the environmental vision of New York City&rsquo;s elected leaders including the New York City Office of the Mayor, Queens Borough President&rsquo;s Office, New York City Council, New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, and New York City Department of Design and Construction.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>  </p>\r\n<p>QBG's Parking Garden demonstrates an alternate way of treating stormwater runoff to keep our waterways cleaner.  </p>\r\n<p>Located in what were originally wetlands, the Parking Garden is reminiscent of an outstretched hand, alternating finger-like parking spaces made of permeable pavers with mini-bioswales that absorb excess water. Sloping away from city streets, remaining runoff is diverted into a series of planted depressions, called bioswales, that absorb the vast majority of the water. The rest is directed into a native wet meadow that mimics local ecosystems that existed in Flushing prior to urbanization.</p>\r\n<p>Permeable pavers rest on three tiers of bluestone gravel of increasing size, allowing water to penetrate deeply into the soil. The structure also facilitates the growth of beneficial oil-eating bacteria that break down leaking car fluids and remove them from the environment.  </p>\r\n<p>  Additional low-intensity parking areas are stabilized with gravel-grass. These flat surfaces are made of large bluestone gravel and seeded with native grasses. The combination absorbs stormwater quickly and is attractive and green when not in use.</p>\r\n<p>In combination with our Visitor &amp; Administration Building, LEED&reg; Platinum certified by the U.S. Green Building Council, and upcoming Sustainable Pathways project, QBG will be capable of diverting 95% of stormwater that falls on our 39 acres from the city's sewer system.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n      </>\r\n    );\r\n  };\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  "]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
