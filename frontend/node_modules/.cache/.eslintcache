Officially opening as\r\n          “The Queens Botanical Garden Society” in 1946 after local residents\r\n          saved and expanded the original exhibit, the Garden remained at the\r\n          original World’s Fair site until 1961, when it was moved to its current\r\n          location on Main Street in Flushing. Among the original plantings taken\r\n          from the 1939 site are two blue atlas cedars that frame the iconic tree\r\n          gate sculpture at the Garden’s Main Street entrance today.

It was a landmark event for the Garden as Mayor Bloomberg cited\r\n        the Visitor &amp; Administration Center as a major asset in the\r\n        city&rsquo;s PlaNYC 2030, the ambitious program to cut New York\r\n        City&rsquo;s carbon emissions by 30%.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The new landscapes being installed are functional, meaning the plants\r\n        and soil all play a role in contributing to a healthier habitat. Many of\r\n        the plants in these new landscapes are indigenous to the New York area,\r\n        including those in the Visitor &amp; Administration Building&rsquo;s\r\n        cleansing biotope, constructed wetland, bioswale, and green roof. The\r\n        structure itself is built on the former site of a parking lot,\r\n        maximizing the space for new landscapes and optimizing reuse. In\r\n        addition to highlighting plants that celebrate cultural connections, the\r\n        Garden Master Plan calls for rebuilding some indigenous plant\r\n        communities&mdash; including woodland, savannah, wetland, ridge and\r\n        swale, and prairie ecosystems.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The Garden encourages the establishment and growth of these communities\r\n        by taking steps to revitalize soils, reintroduce native plants and\r\n        seeds, and implementing controlled burns.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        To keep our collections free of unwanted pests and weeds while\r\n        protecting the environment, the Garden uses Integrated Pest Management\r\n        (IPM). This is a systematic approach to managing pests that focuses on\r\n        long-term prevention with minimal impact on human health, the\r\n        environment, and other plants or animals. Using IPM means that the\r\n        Garden can minimize the use of synthetic chemical pesticides and\r\n        fertilizers in our landscapes. The Garden new Plants in Community\r\n        gardens are organized by plant family and feature native plants in a\r\n        garden setting. More than 15 plant families are highlighted in the\r\n        Plants in Community garden around the Visitor &amp; Administration\r\n        Building. These gardens are grouped according to plant families, such as\r\n        Rosaceae (Rose Family), Liliaceae (Lily Family), and Compositae\r\n        (Aster/Daisy/Sunflower Family).\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h1>\r\n        QBG has the opportunity to share with our visitors the critical role\r\n        that plants play both culturally and ecologically in our lives as well\r\n        as the lives of the creatures that share our ecosystems. At the Garden,\r\n        visitors will have the opportunity to experience beautiful and unique\r\n        gardens and habitats that will provide diverse habitat, become a\r\n        functional part of the local hydrology, and offer new opportunities for\r\n        visitors to connect to plants.\r\n      </h1>\r\n      <h1>Benefits:</h1>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Many people have never had the chance to experience healthy native\r\n        habitats that once occupied New York since many have been changed by\r\n        development, pollution, and the introduction of invasive species of\r\n        plants and animals. Over many years, and with proper stewardship\r\n        practices, the Garden&rsquo;s plant communities will showcase the unique\r\n        role that plants play both culturally and ecologically and provide seed\r\n        sources for future rebuilding and restoration of landscapes in and\r\n        around New York.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <hr />\r\n      <p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        Interior surfaces are left largely unfinished, revealing the raw\r\n        building materials such as steel, wood, and concrete. The carpet used in\r\n        selected areas of the Visitor &amp; Administration Building can be\r\n        endlessly recycled into new carpeting. Interior products, such as\r\n        fabrics, sealants, caulks, and paints, contain no or very low levels of\r\n        volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Most wood-based materials are Forest\r\n        Stewardship Council certified.
