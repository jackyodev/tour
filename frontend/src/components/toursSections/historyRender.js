        <h2> HISTORY </h2>
        <p>
          Located at the northeast corner of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in
          Flushing, the garden evolved from the five-acre “Gardens on Parade” exhibit
          showcased at the 1939-1940 New York World’s Fair. Officially opening as
          “The Queens Botanical Garden Society” in 1946 after local residents
          saved and expanded the original exhibit, the Garden remained at the
          original World’s Fair site until 1961, when it was moved to its current
          location on Main Street in Flushing. Among the original plantings taken
          from the 1939 site are two blue atlas cedars that frame the iconic tree
          gate sculpture at the Garden’s Main Street entrance today. QBG has
          become a 39-acre oasis in one of New York City’s most bustling and
          diverse neighborhoods.

        In 2002, the installation of a new perimeter fence signaled the beginning of a decade of great change at Queens Botanical Garden and was the first capital project completed at garden since 1986.
        </p>

<p>The garden replaced its chain-link fence with an ornamental steel picket fence that encloses and secures the entire 39-acre site.

  <p> 
  Sixty-six stone-faced concrete piers each bear a granite plaque inscribed with the Garden’s name, and bronze medallions of plants native to the area adorn every third or fourth fence panel. 
    </p>

<p>A signature tree sculpture gate graces the Garden’s entrance on Main Street. This elegant representation of the American Hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), a tree known for its toughness and hardwood, was "planted" between two Blue Atlas Cedars (Cedrus atlantica 'Glauca') that have been part of the Garden since its birth as the exhibit Gardens on Parade at the 1939-1940 New York World’s Fair. The tree sculpture gate is dedicated to <i>"the victims and heroes of 9/11 and to the power of hope, healing, and community."</i> </p>

<i>The new perimeter fence has enabled the garden to develop its entire site as a botanic garden and provide a safe, secure environment for its plant collections and visitors.</i>
