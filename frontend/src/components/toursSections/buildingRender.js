<h2>Healthy Paints and Materials</h2>

<p>Paints, glues, and other products used in this building are
designed to keep the air healthy. Most people spend 80 to 90 percent of their
time indoors. Yet studies show that the air inside can be 25 to 62 percent more
polluted than the air outside! </p>

<p>Formaldehyde and other chemicals called volatile organic
compounds, or VOCs, are one major cause of indoor air pollution. They are found
in many common products, including paints, carpets, plywood, upholstery,
pesticides, and household cleaners. They can cause asthma, allergies, and even
cancer. 

The products used inside our building, such as fabrics, sealants, caulks and
paints, and furniture contain no or very low levels of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs). By virtually eliminating them from newer projects the Garden
helps protect the health of its staff and visitors. </p>


<h2>Air Quality Protection - Breath Easily!</h2>

<p>During construction, ducts and other parts of a building’s
ventilation system may become contaminated, causing health problems for
occupants once the building is completed. A strict Indoor Air Quality
Management Plan was followed to prevent such contamination. 

This plan included protection of ductwork and equipment before, during, and
after installation; limitations on dust-producing work; and a two-week flush
out of the ventilation system at the end of the construction phase.</p>

<h2>Smart Lights </h2>

<p>Most lighting systems waste energy. They provide light when
it isn’t needed. Or they provide more light than is necessary. 

Our computer-controlled system automatically adjusts light levels based on how
much natural light is available, or whether anyone is in the room. This
efficient system and a building design that lets in daylight help us cut energy
use by 40 %! As a nation, we use about 25 % of our electricity for lighting. 

You can save energy at home by switching off lights when you don’t need them
and using compact fluorescent light bulbs.</p>


<h2>This Steel Had a Previous Life!</h2>

<p>Much of the steel used in this building is recycled. 

The columns inside and outdoors may contain a can of soup you ate, your
neighbor’s old refrigerator, or your parents’ last car.

Recycling conserves Resources! Recycling one ton of steel saves 2,500 pounds of
iron ore and 1,400 pounds of coal. And by recycling, the steel industry saves
enough energy annually to power 18 million homes for a year! Next time you eat
a can of fruit or open a can of coffee, be sure to recycle the containers. You
never know where they will turn up next.</p>


<h2>Restroom Water Savings</h2>

<p>We’re saving water in these public restrooms. A sensor
automatically turns the water on and off when you put your hands under a faucet
and move them away. The urinals in the Men’s Room use no water at all. Also,
our building’s restrooms include no-flow and low-flow plumbing fixtures that
conserve clean water. 

Instead of going to the city’s overburdened sewer system, used water from the
sinks is cleansed by the sand and plants outdoors in our Constructed Wetland,
then piped back to flush the public toilets. Altogether, we reduced potable water use in our Visitor
Administration Center by up to 82 percent! </p>

<h2>What Do You Do With a Plant That Can Grow Four Feet a Day? -
Bamboo Wall</h2>

<p>Use it as a renewable resource! Have you ever eaten bamboo
shoots? Taken banslochan to treat a cold? Sat on a bamboo chair? If so, you
have used bamboo, too. 

For centuries, bamboo has been an important building material in Asia from
decorative artwork, paper, bicycles, bed linens, clothing, musical instruments,
aqueducts, and earthquake-hardy homes are a few unique things made from bamboo.

<p> 
  In Chinese bamboo is known as zhu in Korean as dae "대" or daenamu 대나무, and in Hindi as baans or venoo. It is a symbol of longevity in China and friendship in India, bamboo holds
significant symbolic meanings and is highlighted in the mythology and folklore
of many cultures around the world. 
  </p>

  <p>The wall rising from our building’s lobby to the second floor is made of reformed
bamboo. There are over 1,000 species of bamboo and people around the world have
relied on it for food, shelter, and everyday needs throughout history. </p>


<p>
Bamboo is a renewable resource and when used as a substitute for wood, helps
protect forests from being destroyed; however, bamboo can also be highly
invasive and threatening to the native ecosystems.
</p>

<h3>Urban Heat Island Effect</h3>

<p>Dark surfaces, like asphalt, concrete, and tar roofing,
absorb heat from the sun during the day and slowly release it at night.

In dense urban areas like New York, this
makes nighttime temperatures much hotter than in natural areas, especially
during the summer. The lack of nighttime cooling stresses many different plant and animal species, making it hard for
them to survive in the city. It also means that air conditioners need to work harder to cool indoor spaces.

Light-colored surfaces, like the canopy roof and plaza pavers, reflect light,
while planted areas like the green roof stay naturally cool due to plant
respiration. These steps reduce the urban heat island effect around our
building. You can do the same thing around your home by planting a garden and
using light-colored material on your roof and paved surfaces.</p>

<h3>Native Plants and Integrated Pest Management</h3>

<p>Choosing appropriate plants is the most important part of
having an environmentally friendly garden. Most of the plants used on and around the new building are native
species. This means that they have evolved in this area and are well adapted to
rainfall and temperature conditions.

To keep our plants healthy, the Garden uses Integrated Pest Management (IPM).
This is a systematic approach to managing unwanted weeds and pests without
harming human health or the environment. IPM takes advantage of the biological
cycles of the many interdependent organisms within an ecosystem.

Using native plants and IPM means that our new garden collections and
landscaping need no artificial irrigation and minimal synthetic pesticides and
fertilizers.</p>



<h3>Green Roof</h3>

<p>Green roofs, also known as vegetated or planted roofs,
provide habitat for plants, insects, and birds where an empty roof would
usually be. They also reduce stormwater runoff, supply added insulation and
roof protection, and reduce the surrounding air temperature during the
summer. </p>

<p>
They are built on top of a regular roof in layers. These include a protective
layer that keeps the green roof from leaking or damaging the roof below, a
drainage layer that keeps the green roof from becoming waterlogged, and a
growing layer with extra lightweight soil for the plant roots.</p>

<p> 
Our new, 8,000 square-foot green roof has many different native plant species,
such as Little Bluestem Grass (Andropogon scoparius) and Prairie Dropseed
(Sporobolus heterolepis). Visitors can walk up the sloping roof to experience
the landscape firsthand and enjoy a scenic view of the Queens Botanical Garden.
</p>




<h3>Forest Stewardship Council Certified Wood</h3>

<p>Most of the wood-based materials used in our new building
are Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified. The building’s façade is made
from FSC certified Western Red Cedar (Thuja plicata), harvested in the Pacific
Northwest, where it plays a vital role in native American cultures.

The Forest Stewardship Council is an international organization that
establishes independent standards for wood harvesting and forest management
based on environmental, economic and social criteria. Using FSC certified wood
helps protect forest ecosystems and benefits communities that rely on forests.

All FSC certified products are stamped with the FSC symbol. Look for this
symbol when you buy things like plywood, furniture, paper and other wood-based
materials.</p>



<h3>Constructed Wetland and Graywater Recycling System </h3>

<p>Though it covers a relatively small area, the Constructed
Wetland features a variety of wetland plants native to the area. Bottlebrush
Sedge (Carex comosa), Great Bulrush (Scirpus validus), Marsh Fern (Thelypteris
palustris) thrive and Cardinal Flower (Lobelia cardinalis) adds a dash of
color. This landscape evokes the wetland plant communities that once existed
throughout the region.

But what you can see above ground is only half the story: the Constructed
Wetland is also a functional landscape, filling an important role in the
Visitor Administration Building’s water recycling system. 
Water that goes down the drain in sinks, showers, dishwashers and most other
sources besides toilets and urinals is called graywater. Usually this water
goes to the sewer, but in our building, graywater is recycled.

First, gray water is piped out of the building to underground settling tanks,
which allows larger debris to sink out of the water. Then it goes to the
Constructed Wetland, where it is slowly released below ground. As the water
seeps through layers of gravel and sand, contaminants are filtered out. Once it
reaches the root zones of the wetland plants, organic nutrients, metals, and
other contaminants are naturally treated and absorbed by the plants.

After moving through the Constructed Wetland, the cleaned water is collected
and piped back into the Visitor Administration Building, where it is used
to flush toilets. </p>

<p>
The Constructed Wetland can clean and recycle up to 4,000 gallons of water a
week. This saves more fresh water in a week than a typical person drinks in
twenty years! It also prevents water pollution by reducing the amount of water that enters New York City’s
overburdened sewer system.</p>



<h3>Geothermal System</h3>

<p>Buildings use more energy for heating and air conditioning
than anything else. To save energy, the Visitor
&amp; Administration Building’s Geothermal System taps the heat of the earth to
provide heating and cooling for the building and eliminates the need to burn
any fossil fuels on-site.</p>


<p>The Geothermal System uses 75% less energy than regular
heating and air conditioning, saving about as much energy as it takes to light
the Statue of Liberty!

1. Water from an aquifer 300 feet underground is pumped into the building from
a well near the building. Because it is buried so deep, this water remains
approximately 55 degrees F year-round. The amount of water pumped adjusts automatically based on the current
heating or cooling needs of the building.

2. The water is then piped into the building’s mechanical room.

3. In the building’s mechanical room, the well water flows through coils of
pipe within pieces of equipment called heat exchangers.
At the same time, other coils of pipe carry
water from the building’s heating and cooling system through the same heat
exchangers. During the winter, the exchangers transfer heat energy from the
well water into the system water, heating it to 115 degrees Fahrenheit. During the summer, heat energy is transferred
from the system water to the well water, leaving the system water 45 degrees
Fahrenheit.

4. After the transfer, the well water is pumped back into the underground
aquifer.

5. The heated or cooled water is piped to ventilation equipment throughout the
building.

6. The building’s ventilation equipment uses the heated or cooled water to heat
or cool fresh air.

7.This air is blown through vents into the building’s occupied areas, heating and cooling these spaces. The rate and temperature of this air is
automatically adjusted based on the temperature and quality of air in each
different part of the building.

8. The water used in the heating and cooling system is cycled back to the heat
exchangers.</p>



<h3>Construction Waste Management</h3>

<p>Over 75% of the waste produced during the construction of
the Visitor &amp; Administration Building was diverted from the landfill
through recycling and reuse. </p>


<h3>Solar Panels</h3>

<p>Solar panels use the photovoltaic process to capture the
sun’s energy and covert it into electricity.

A solar array is made up of a group of solar panels, often called modules. Our building has an array of 78 modules on
the roof. Each module is made of many individual photovoltaic cells.

The photovoltaic cells are made of two separate layers of material, which is
mostly silicon.The two layers are
connected by a wire.

When sunlight strikes the surface of the cell, it frees electrons in the top
layer of the cell and they begin to move through the wire to the bottom
layer. The more intense the sunlight, the more electrons will be freed and the more rapidly they will move through
the wire. </p>


<h3>Inverter</h3>

<p>The inverter converts direct current (DC) electricity from
the array into alternating current (AC) electricity. Most electrical devices
like lights, and computers, use AC electricity.</p>


<h3>Electric Meter</h3>

<p>The electric meter measures electrical energy produced by
the solar panels. Electrical energy is measured in kilowatt-hours. Our solar panels can produce up to 16
kilowatt-hours in an hour. They produce
more electricity when the sun is shining more intensely. - Irradiance is the
amount of electromagnetic energy (solar radiation) falling on a surface over a
specific time and is most efficient when
there is uniform light coverage of the photovoltaic (PV) arrays.

Electricity generated by the solar energy system, combined with electricity
from the electric utility company, is routed to the building. The more electricity generated by the solar
energy system, the less electricity needs to be brought into the building from
the electric utility.

Coverage will be affected by the angle of direct and indirect sunlight falling
on the arrays, which changes throughout the year and because of season.</p>


<h3>Recycled and Recyclable Materials</h3>

<p>Using recycled material limits the amount of waste that must
be disposed of in landfills or incinerators, and reduces the resources used to
produce new products and material.

In the Visitor &amp; Administration Building, office materials and furnishings
incorporate a high percentage of recycled content, and many can be recycled at
the end of their useful life. For example, the carpeting used in some offices
is a cradle-to-cradle certified product, meaning it can be continually recycled
into new carpeting with very little waste. 

The carpet also contains very low levels of volatile organic compounds, which
helps protect the health of staff members.</p>


<h3>Efficient Lighting System</h3>

<p>The building uses a Digital Addressable Lighting Interface
(DALI) system to control the building’s artificial lights.

This means that light levels are automatically adjusted in each area based on
available natural light and presence of occupants.

Using this efficient DALI system and a building design that brings in abundant
natural light will help us use 40% less energy for artificial lighting, each
year saving enough electricity to light the top of the Empire State Building
for three days straight.</p>


<h3>Efficient Ventilation System</h3>

<p>Ventilation system in the building designed to maximize the comfort of occupants
while using as little energy as possible. 

Our building’s operable windows are well placed to provide natural ventilation
during good weather, reducing the workload of the ventilation system. Numerous
thermostats and CO2 sensors monitor occupied areas and automatically control
the ventilation system.

Air is added to each area of the building at just the right rate and
temperature to ensure good air quality and the comfort of visitors and staff.
The ventilation system uses the building’s geothermal system to produce heated
and cooled air.</p>



<h3>Natural Lighting and Ventilation - These Windows Save
Energy! </h3>

<p>Cultures around the world have traditionally made shelters
and buildings that work with nature, through appropriate siting, carefully
sized and placed openings, and features like the brise soleil, to provide
comfortable and healthy living and working spaces. 

The long, narrow architecture allow 90% of the interior space to receive
daylight and maximize natural ventilation. The large windows allow our visitors
and staff members to enjoy views of the Garden and reduce the need for
electrical lighting. 

Operable windows allow fresh air to enter the building. In the administrative
offices, floor to ceiling windows are screened by a wooden brise soleil that
permits light and heat during the winter and shades the interior in the summer.
It enable staff and visitors to enjoy beautiful garden views. They let daylight
in, reducing the need for artificial lighting. Some can be opened for fresh
air. Their glass has an invisible metallic layer called a low-E coating that
keeps heat inside in winter and keeps out the sun’s hot rays in summer.

Most heat gain and loss through windows can account for 50 % of the energy used
to heat and cool a house.</p>



<h3>Energy Star Appliances</h3>

<p>Energy Star certified appliances in the office are purchased
for their efficiency. To earn the Energy Star, products must meet strict energy
efficiency criteria set by the US Environmental Protection Agency or the US
Department of Energy. 

For example, Energy Star refrigerators, like those used in our building, are at
least 15% more efficient than the minimum federal efficiency standard. Buying
appliances with the Energy Star label saves energy and money.</p>



<h3>Why Waste Human Waste? - Composting Toilets</h3>

<p>The restrooms on our building’s second floor are composting
toilets, which require very little water and prevent water pollution by keeping
waste out of the sewer system.

Mild, biodegradable soap and water carry the waste to a composting tank below.
There, bacteria, fungi, and earthworms turn it into compost, just as in a
compost pile. The resulting compost looks and smells like topsoil. The toilet
uses only 3 to 6 ounces of recycled water for flushing. Compare this to the
typical toilet, which uses 1.6 gallons! And no water or waste goes into the
city’s overburdened sewage system.</p>



<h3>Sustainable Siting</h3>

<p>The Visitor &amp; Administration Building is built on the
site of the Garden’s former parking lot. Putting our building here protects
existing green space and maximizes space for new landscapes. It is located
close to public transportation, allowing staff and visitors to travel to the
Garden with less environmental impact.</p>


<h3>Sun Shade (Brise Soleil)</h3>

<p>The horizontal strips of wood over the windows are called
brise soleil, which means “sun break” in French. Our building’s distinctive
brise soleil lets sunlight and heat into interior offices during winter and
shades them in the summer. This saves energy in lighting, heating and cooling.

The brise soleil is made of Forest Stewardship Council certified wood that was
harvested and milled locally. The species of wood used is Black Locust (Robinia
pseudoacacia), a common domestic hardwood. Over 20% of the materials used in
the building have been harvested or manufactured within 500 miles. Using local
material saves energy and money on transportation and supports the local
economy. 

A brise soleil is one type of sun-shading device but many design elements used
to screen the sun appear in Islamic, Japanese and Caribbean architectural
traditions, among others. For example, sudare are blinds or screens made out of
slats of decorative wood or bamboo in many Japanese homes.</p>


<h3>Bioswale </h3>

<p>When it rains, water from surrounding areas and overflow
from the Cleansing Biotope runs into this bioswale.

A bioswale is a low-lying area planted with vegetation that can tolerate wet
and dry conditions. Water flows into a special soil that maximizes retention.
It then evaporates, is absorbed by plants, and allowed to filter back into the
water table. Some of the plant species in the Garden’s bioswales include Great
Blue Lobelia (Lobelia siphilitica) and Shallow Sedge (Carex lurida).

Bioswales are one of the Garden’s most important stormwater management tools.
They prevent water pollution by keeping stormwater out of New York City’s
combined wastewater system, where it often mixes with raw sewage before being
released into area waterways. </p>


<h3>Cleansing Biotope</h3>

<p>The Cleansing Biotope is an area planted with selected
native wetland species such as Soft Rush (Juncus effusus) and Lizard’s Tail
(Saururus cernuus).

During a storm, rainwater runs off the terrace canopy into the Cleansing
Biotope. The water filters into the soil and through the root zones of the
wetland plants, where organic nutrients, metals and other contaminants are
naturally treated and absorbed by the plants.

After it is cleaned, the water is piped underground to splash out of the Entry
Plaza fountain. Then it flows alongside the Visitor &amp; Administration
Building back to the Cleansing Biotope to begin the cycle again.

Recycling rainwater conserves fresh water and helps prevent water pollution in
the area’s waterways.</p>


<h3>Extra Insulation</h3>

<p>The Visitor Administration Building’s exterior walls
have thicker insulation (over eight inches in many places) than in most
buildings. This reduces the energy needed to heat and cool the building and
keeps the occupants comfortable in all weather. 

The insulation used in our building is made of up to 85% post-consumer recycled
material and contains low levels of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs).</p>


<h3>Plants in Community </h3>

<p>Plants have families too. Our new Plants in Community gardens
are organized by plant family and feature native plants in a garden setting.
More than 15 plant families are highlighted in the Plants in Community gardens
around the Visitor Administration Building. These gardens are grouped
according to plant family, such as Rosaceae (Rose family), Liliaceae (Lily
family) and Compositae (Aster/Daisy/Sunflower family).</p>
