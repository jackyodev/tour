      <h1>Cleansing Biotope </h1>
      <p>
        The Garden’s Cleansing Biotope, located at the western end of the
        Visitor & Administration Building, is an area planted with selected
        native wetland species such as Soft Rush (Juncus effusus) and Swordgrass
        (Scirpus americanus). During a storm, rainwater runs off the roofs of
        the building and terrace and other impermeable surfaces into the
        Cleansing Biotope. The water filters through the plant root systems,
        where contaminants are removed and treated by bacterial activity on the
        root surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cleansed water is stored in a 24,000-gallon underground cistern and
        eventually piped underground to the entry plaza fountain. After gurgling
        out of the fountain, the water flows across the plaza through a water
        channel planted with native vegetation. At the end of the plaza, the
        water channel turns and runs alongside the Visitor & Administration
        Building, bringing the water back to the Cleansing Biotope to begin the
        cycle again.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the water used in the fountain and water feature is provided in
        this way, conserving freshwater while reducing stress on New York City’s
        wastewater system.
      </p>

      <h1>Bioswales </h1>
      <p>
        Bioswales are another integral part of QBG’s stormwater management plan.
        These low-lying areas have been selected or excavated and planted with
        vegetation that can tolerate wet and dry conditions. When it rains,
        water runs off surrounding areas into a bioswale. There, the water is
        retained in the soil (a special soil mixture can be used to maximize
        retention), evaporated, absorbed by plants, and allowed to infiltrate
        back into the water table. At the Garden, three bioswales have been
        completed as part of the Sustainable Landscapes & Buildings project.
        They manage excess rainwater runoff from the new buildings and paved
        areas. All of the stormwater that falls on the parking surface of the
        Parking Garden is also managed by bioswales.
