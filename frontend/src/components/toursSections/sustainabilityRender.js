        Queens Botanical Garden teaches and practices sustainability in design,
        construction, and operations support; environmental stewardship;
        long-term financial viability; and the health of visitors, staff, and
        the community.
      </div>
      <div>
        The Garden&rsquo;s <a>Master Plan of 2001</a> launched the Sustainable
        Landscapes and Buildings Project. As the name implies, the project is
        much more than buildings. It includes new plants, many of which are
        native species; bioswales to collect stormwater and reduce wear-and-tear
        on New York City&rsquo;s combined sewer system; water recycling systems;
        the new Horticulture/Maintenance Building; the revolutionary Visitor
        &amp; Administration Center; and the transformation of our existing
        parking lot into a 125-space parking garden which began in September
        2008.
      </div>
      <div>On September 27, 2007, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, </div>
      <p>
        Borough President Helen Marshall, whose office has been the lead
        supporter of the Sustainable Buildings and Landscape Project, and
        numerous other dignitaries officially opened our Visitor &amp;
        Administration Center, the most advanced green building in New York
        City. It was a landmark event for the Garden as Mayor Bloomberg cited
        the Visitor &amp; Administration Center as a major asset in the
        city&rsquo;s PlaNYC 2030, the ambitious program to cut New York
        City&rsquo;s carbon emissions by 30%.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new landscapes being installed are functional, meaning the plants
        and soil all play a role in contributing to a healthier habitat. Many of
        the plants in these new landscapes are indigenous to the New York area,
        including those in the Visitor &amp; Administration Building&rsquo;s
        cleansing biotope, constructed wetland, bioswale, and green roof. The
        structure itself is built on the former site of a parking lot,
        maximizing the space for new landscapes and optimizing reuse. In
        addition to highlighting plants that celebrate cultural connections, the
        Garden Master Plan calls for rebuilding some indigenous plant
        communities&mdash; including woodland, savannah, wetland, ridge and
        swale, and prairie ecosystems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Garden encourages the establishment and growth of these communities
        by taking steps to revitalize soils, reintroduce native plants and
        seeds, and implementing controlled burns.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        To keep our collections free of unwanted pests and weeds while
        protecting the environment, the Garden uses Integrated Pest Management
        (IPM). This is a systematic approach to managing pests that focuses on
        long-term prevention with minimal impact on human health, the
        environment, and other plants or animals. Using IPM means that the
        Garden can minimize the use of synthetic chemical pesticides and
        fertilizers in our landscapes. The Garden new Plants in Community
        gardens are organized by plant family and feature native plants in a
        garden setting. More than 15 plant families are highlighted in the
        Plants in Community garden around the Visitor &amp; Administration
        Building. These gardens are grouped according to plant families, such as
        Rosaceae (Rose Family), Liliaceae (Lily Family), and Compositae
        (Aster/Daisy/Sunflower Family).

        QBG has the opportunity to share with our visitors the critical role
        that plants play both culturally and ecologically in our lives as well
        as the lives of the creatures that share our ecosystems. At the Garden,
        visitors will have the opportunity to experience beautiful and unique
        gardens and habitats that will provide diverse habitat, become a
        functional part of the local hydrology, and offer new opportunities for
        visitors to connect to plants.
      </h1>
      <h1>Benefits:</h1>
      <p>
        Many people have never had the chance to experience healthy native
        habitats that once occupied New York since many have been changed by
        development, pollution, and the introduction of invasive species of
        plants and animals. Over many years, and with proper stewardship
        practices, the Garden&rsquo;s plant communities will showcase the unique
        role that plants play both culturally and ecologically and provide seed
        sources for future rebuilding and restoration of landscapes in and
        around New York.

        Interior surfaces are left largely unfinished, revealing the raw
        building materials such as steel, wood, and concrete. The carpet used in
        selected areas of the Visitor &amp; Administration Building can be
        endlessly recycled into new carpeting. Interior products, such as
        fabrics, sealants, caulks, and paints, contain no or very low levels of
        volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Most wood-based materials are Forest
        Stewardship Council certified. In the Garden&rsquo;s new structures,
        building materials and furnishings incorporate a high percentage of
        recycled content, and over 20% are produced within 500 miles. Over 75%
        of the waste produced during the construction of the Visitor &amp;
        Administration Building has been diverted from the landfill through
        recycling and reuse.
      </p>
      <h1>Benefits:</h1>
      <p>
        Using recycled material limits the amount of waste that must be disposed
        of in landfills or incinerators, and reduces the resources used to
        produce new products and material. Purchasing material locally saves
        energy and money on transportation and supports the local economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are chemicals found in many common
        products and building materials that can escape into the air and cause
        illness and allergic reactions. By virtually eliminating them from new
        buildings, the Garden will help protect the respiratory health of its
        staff and visitors.
      </p>

        Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification ensures responsible
        forestry methods were used in the harvesting of timber products.

      <p>
        Gray water from the Visitor &amp; Administration Building&rsquo;s sinks,
        dishwashers, and shower is piped to a constructed wetland, while
        rainwater cascades off the terrace roof into a <a>cleansing biotope</a>.
        In both places, water is filtered and treated naturally through
        bacterial activity on the roots of carefully selected plants. The
        treated gray water is returned to the building for use in toilet
        flushing, while the cleansed rainwater supplies a meandering water
        feature and fountain. Low maintenance, drought-resistant plants are used
        in Garden landscapes to reduce the need for irrigation. Throughout the
        project, rainwater is filtered and absorbed into the soil through{" "}
        <a>bioswales</a> instead of entering the city&rsquo;s combined sewer,
        reducing pollution in Long Island Sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a>A green roof planted</a> with mostly native plant species absorbs
        rainwater that falls on the Visitor &amp; Administration Building
        auditorium. Rainwater that falls on the Horticulture/Maintenance
        Building is collected and stored in an underground cistern. A piping
        system connects this cistern to the building&rsquo;s storage and garage
        space, where the water is used to wash vehicles and tools.
      </p>
      <h1>Benefits:</h1>
      <p>
        Conserving fresh water and recycling water to use in place of freshwater
        reduces the burden on the city&rsquo;s water supply system and
        vulnerability to drought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collecting, storing, and recycling gray water and rainwater onsite
        diverts it from the city&rsquo;s costly, energy-intensive wastewater
        treatment process. These strategies also prevent the release of polluted
        water into local waterways during large storms, when the city&rsquo;s
        wastewater treatment system is overwhelmed.

        In the Horticulture/Maintenance Building, translucent siding allows
        daylight to reach interior workspaces, reducing the need for electrical
        lighting.
        <br /> The Visitor &amp; Administration Building&rsquo;s orientation and
        long, narrow architecture allow 90% of the interior space to receive
        daylight and maximize natural ventilation. A <a>
          geothermal system
        </a>{" "}
        uses the earth&rsquo;s constant temperature to provide seasonal heating
        and cooling. Rooftop <a>photovoltaic cells</a> transform sunlight into
        electricity to operate high-efficiency ventilation and lighting systems.
      </p>
      <h1>Benefits:</h1>
      <p>
        Overall, the Visitor &amp; Administration Building will use
        approximately 40% less energy from nonrenewable sources than a typical
        building of its size. Every year this will prevent the release of over
        forty tons of the greenhouse gas CO2 into the atmosphere, the equivalent
        of removing nine cars from the road. Annual energy costs will be reduced
        by over $7,000, a savings passed on to New York City taxpayers.

        The Queens Botanical Garden is located on 39 acres of land owned by New
        York City, the legacy of the 1939 and 1964 World's Fairs. It is open to
        the public, and admission is free.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Visitor and Administration Center includes a reception area, an
        auditorium, a garden store, gallery space, meeting rooms, administrative
        offices, and a mechanical room. The project is made up of three
        interconnected spaces: a forecourt and roof canopy, a linear central
        reception and administration building clad in wood and glass, and an
        auditorium space tucked into the landscape, sheltered by a sloping green
        roof.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <strong>Environmental Aspects</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Visitor and Administration Center was designed to celebrate the
        relationship between diverse cultures and the environment and to
        showcase water management, landscape integration, and energy
        conservation and generation. The Queens Botanical Garden is accessible
        by public transportation, and showers and changing areas encourage
        employees to bike or walk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reusing graywater for flushing toilets reduces the project's potable
        water consumption by 55%. The building also features waterless urinals
        and composting toilets. Thanks to extensive bioswales and a green roof
        on the auditorium, the project manages all stormwater on site. A water
        channel, fed by rainwater that cascades off the roof canopy, weaves
        around the building and through the gardens.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reception building's long, narrow shape is oriented along an
        east-west axis, allowing daylight to penetrate all interior spaces. An
        efficient lighting system, daylight dimming, and occupancy sensors
        reduce energy consumption. Glass doors and windows open in temperate
        weather, providing natural ventilation. The building uses photovoltaic
        panels and a ground-source heat-pump system to harvest energy on-site.
      </p>
      <p>
        More than 33% of the materials in the building, by cost, were harvested
        or manufactured within 500 miles of the project site. The project team
        also preferred materials with high durability, low maintenance
        requirements, recycled content, low chemical emissions, and Forest
        Stewardship Council certification.
      </p>
      <p>
        The now-reclaimed land on which the Queens Botanical Garden is located
        was famously described in F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 book The Great
        Gatsby as "a valley of ashes."{" "}
      </p>
      <div>
        {" "}
        Today, the Garden is located at the nexus of the most ethnically diverse
        county in the United States. More than 130 languages and dialects are
        spoken in the area.
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Community-based programming includes gardening for children and
          seniors, seasonal celebrations, weddings, daily tai chi practice, and
          classes for visitors and professionals on everything from renewable
          energy to green landscaping and composting. The building design is the
          result of a community-driven planning process. A variety of assembly
          spaces within the Center, both open to the landscape and sheltered
          from the elements, shape visitors' experience of the Gardens.{" "}
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          The Garden is accessible by public transportation. Showers located in
          the building encourage employees to commute by biking or walking.
          Parking options include designated spaces for carpools and
          alternative-fuel vehicles. The Garden is also converting its own
          vehicle fleet to electric vehicles.

        The building is nestled among mature trees on the{" "}
        <strong>site of a former parking lot</strong>.
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>
          The flood-prone site, which once included a creek, has been filled and
          excavated a number of times, and the existing soil had no original
          structure remaining. All grounds not designated for intensive use were
          planted with native species, reinvigorating the depleted soils. The
          construction team took care during grading to preserve the extensive
          root zones.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The community-driven planning process emphasized the importance of{" "}
          <strong>water as a resource vital to all cultures</strong>. As a
          result, the project team used water to unify the building and the
          landscape. Through the use of water, the team hoped to recall the
          creek that once ran through the site and to inspire new thinking about
          water conservation and living landscapes.

        <p>
          During rainy days,{" "}
          <strong>
            water cascades off of the sheltering canopy roof and into a channel
            flowing between the main building and the auditorium
          </strong>
          . The captured rainwater moves through biotope pools filled with
          gravel and native wetland species that cleanse the rainwater before it
          is piped underground. The water then emerges at the entry plaza
          fountain, moves through the landscape via a meandering stream, and
          returns to the biotope to begin the cycle anew. The water levels vary
          in response to the weather and season.
        </p>
        <p>
          The landscape manages all precipitation on site. Planted bioswales
          throughout the gardens collect rainwater that falls on the site, and
          rainwater that falls on the auditorium's green roof sustains the
          roof's plantings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Center is composed of three interconnected spaces:{" "}
          <strong>the forecourt</strong> and <strong>roof canopy</strong>, the
          linear reception and administration building, and the auditorium,
          which is sheltered by a sloping green roof. Each part of the structure
          reduces energy use through the use of passive design strategies
          tailored to the local climate.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        The dramatic roof canopy provides a basic shelter that emulates the
        adjacent alley of mature oaks. The top surface of the canopy is covered
        with a reflective material, reducing solar heat gain and minimizing the
        project's contribution to the urban heat-island effect. The long and
        narrow shape of the central reception building allows daylight to
        penetrate all interior spaces.
      </p>
      <div>
        A wooden brise-soleil wraps the western and southern walls of the
        building to reduce unwanted heat gain and glare. On temperate days,
        glass doors and windows slide open to provide cross ventilation.
      </div>
      <div>
        {" "}
        The semi-intensive green roof of the auditorium, planted with native
        species, provides thermal insulation as well as acoustical insulation
        from the flight path overhead. Skylights and a long window with a
        frogs-eye view of the water channel bring light into this partially
        underground space.
      </div>
      <p>
        On temperate days, sliding glass doors and windows on the main building
        can be opened in all occupied spaces, connecting the building's
        occupants directly to the gardens. The narrow footprint and open-plan
        reception and workspaces allow diffuse light, filtered through the
        brise-soleil, to penetrate the interior.
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        The project is well insulated through conventional insulation as well as
        the auditorium's green roof, contributing to a thermally consistent,
        quiet, and comfortable indoor environment. The lighting system responds
        to occupancy and daylight levels, providing a visually pleasing
        environment while reducing energy use.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project team left the structure and systems exposed whenever
        possible; where paints, finishes, and carpeting were used, the team
        selected products with low chemical emissions.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        The team also followed a construction indoor air quality plan that
        ensured separate ventilation to contain construction dust and required a
        two-week building flush-out with 100% outside air.

        A greywater system that is separate from the stormwater system uses an
        adjacent wetland to cleanse and repurpose building water for flushing
        toilets, reducing the project's potable water consumption by 55%. The
        project also features waterless urinals and composting toilets.{" "}

      <p>
        The project goal was to not only generate energy to meet building needs,
        but to teach visitors about the passive design principles and
        technological strategies employed. The new building creates energy by
        harvesting nature and reduces energy use by design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall the new Visitor and Administration Center will realize a 40.5%
        cost savings compared to a typical building of its size. A geothermal
        heat exchange system uses the earth's constant temperature to reduce
        nonrenewable energy use. Atop the roof of the main building, integrated
        photovoltaic panels provide 17.5% of the complex's electricity needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The narrow building is east-west oriented and designed to encourage
        natural ventilation and daylighting. 84% of interior spaces receive
        daylight and all occupied rooms feature operable windows. The
        brise-soleil is designed to provide thermal comfort, consistent light
        levels and full views of the surrounding garden.{" "}
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        A DALI lighting system, daylight dimming and motion detection reduces
        energy consumption. The building is well insulated, and the green roof
        atop the auditorium further enhances the insulation value.
      </p>
      <p>
        More than 33% of the materials in the building, by cost, were harvested
        or manufactured within 500 miles of the project site. Locally salvaged
        hemlock was used for the concrete formwork, and black locust certified
        to Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards was used for the bridges,
        outdoor benches, and brise-soleil. The building siding is FSC-certified
        western red cedar.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        The wallboard, tile, carpet, office systems, and bathroom partitions all
        contain recycled content, and the concrete used for cast-in-place and
        architectural applications includes blast furnace slag and recycled
        steel reinforcing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project team also selected materials to improve indoor environmental
        quality. The colors of exterior surfaces were selected to reflect light,
        cooling interior spaces. A wooden brise-soleil and low-emissivity glass
        wrap the western and southern walls of the building, deflecting harsh
        sun and blocking ultraviolet rays. All interior finishes contain low or
        no volatile organic compounds.

        The Queens Botanical Garden has implemented a comprehensive recycling
        and waste-reduction program.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project team relied on concrete, steel, and glass for much of the
        project's structure in order to enhance durability and reduce
        maintenance requirements. The team also used finish materials sparingly,
        exposing the character of those materials. The green roof covering the
        auditorium space, solar-reflecting waterproofing material on the canopy,
        and brise-soleil shield the building from sun and water damage. Many of
        the finish materials, including the carpet and office systems, are
        modular and recyclable. The project's open office plan and variety of
        gathering spaces enhance programming flexibility. Major building systems
        were left exposed for ease of future upgrades.

        The borough of Queens is fast becoming a hub for ecological innovation,
        and the Queens Botanical Garden Visitor Center has influenced
        administration and policy throughout the city, including through a new
        local law that mandates LEED certification for all new City-funded
        construction. Mayor Michael Bloomberg opened the Center, praising it as
        a prototype for future buildings and an important asset in the
        development of PlaNYC 2030, the City program for implementing green
        practices and reducing carbon emissions 30% by the year 2030.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        There were challenges during the building process. As the first project
        in the city designed to attain a LEED Platinum rating, the team was
        largely inexperienced. We were guided by consultants and used the
        construction of a maintenance building for the Garden as a practice
        project. New York State's &ldquo;Wick&rsquo;s Law&rdquo; necessitated
        the separation of construction trades, but the design of the building
        systems was heavily integrated. Careful documentation of responsibility
        was essential. Contractors with good construction standards easily
        adjusted to the necessary erosion control, tree protection, and indoor
        air quality inspections.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        We learned that green design involves rethinking the way we design
        buildings and manage construction processes. Green design influenced the
        form of the whole building and was a driving force behind our design. If
        architecture is to play a leading role in the creation of a sustainable
        culture, it must inspire communities to connect more profoundly with the
        natural world.

        <strong>Cost and Payback Analysis: </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Environmental responsibility was not the civic priority it is today when
        the Garden began a capital campaign to fund the project ten years ago.
        New York City stepped forward to support the initiative, and the project
        became a model for civic structures when it was selected as a pilot
        project for New York City's High-Performance Green Buildings Initiative.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the New York City Office of Sustainable Design and Construction,
        the project received grants from the New York State Energy Research and
        Development Authority (NYSERDA) that funded energy efficiency testing,
        energy modeling, geothermal testing, and photovoltaic systems.

        <strong>Process and Results: </strong>
      </p>
      <p>Predesign</p>
      <p>
        The Queens Botanical Garden was committed to a comprehensive greening
        initiative from the start.
      </p>
      <p>
        The predesign process involved community members representing different
        cultures who collectively promoted environmental stewardship. The design
        team involved children and adults from the community in design
        workshops.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Design</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Preprogramming during design development reduced the enclosed,
        conditioned area of the building by one-third. Strategies included the
        elimination of a glass-walled atrium that the Garden had originally
        requested and the creation of a large canopy over the entrance forecourt
        to form a naturally conditioned, outdoor gathering space.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Construction</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The implementation of integrated water systems was complicated by
        existing laws that mandate the separation of construction trades.
      </p>
      <p>
        Close supervision was important to maintain best practices and comply
        with LEED guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Operations/Maintenance</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Interpretive touchscreens display information about the building and
        grounds, including real-time energy data. The information on the
        touchscreens and signage has been translated into four languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Post-Occupancy</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A grant-funded monitoring project will track the air temperature, plant
        surface temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, and soil
        temperature on the auditorium's green roof. The data will be provided to
        researchers and displayed on in-house interpretive touchscreens, which
        are available to all visitors. Additional data collection, including
        water sampling and video monitoring, may be added in the future.

        The Parking Garden is composed of a variety of paving materials
        including permeable pavers to allow infiltration of water and parking
        bays interrupted by planted bioswales that manage stormwater on site. It
        include 6 ADA compliant spaces, 92 standard spaces and 19 overflow
        spaces (composed of grass grown in a gravel medium) for 117 total
        spaces. These new landscapes all contribute to QBG&rsquo;s efforts to
        foster environmental stewardship and enhance the visitor experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Queens Botanical Garden&rsquo;s Parking Garden is another innovative
        component of the Sustainable Landscapes and Buildings Project,
        furthering the environmental vision outlined in our Master Plan.
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>
          Demonstrating a more environmentally-sensitive method of managing
          stormwater onsite, the Parking Garden will help keep our city&rsquo;s
          rivers and bays clean by easing the burden on the city&rsquo;s sewer
          system, while offering visitors comfortable and inspiring gardens.
          Like other features of QBG, the Parking Garden showcases sustainable
          practices in design, construction, and operations to protect the
          health of the environment, community, and future generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Parking Garden and Sustainable Landscapes and Buildings Project
          were made possible by a dedicated team of professionals from Queens
          Botanical Garden, city agencies, consultants and contractors. Queens
          Botanical Garden is thankful for Leadership Support and the
          environmental vision of New York City&rsquo;s elected leaders
          including the New York City Office of the Mayor, Queens Borough
          President&rsquo;s Office, New York City Council, New York City
          Department of Cultural Affairs, and New York City Department of Design
          and Construction.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        QBG's Parking Garden demonstrates an alternate way of treating
        stormwater runoff to keep our waterways cleaner.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Located in what were originally wetlands, the Parking Garden is
        reminiscent of an outstretched hand, alternating finger-like parking
        spaces made of permeable pavers with mini-bioswales that absorb excess
        water. Sloping away from city streets, remaining runoff is diverted into
        a series of planted depressions, called bioswales, that absorb the vast
        majority of the water. The rest is directed into a native wet meadow
        that mimics local ecosystems that existed in Flushing prior to
        urbanization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Permeable pavers rest on three tiers of bluestone gravel of increasing
        size, allowing water to penetrate deeply into the soil. The structure
        also facilitates the growth of beneficial oil-eating bacteria that break
        down leaking car fluids and remove them from the environment.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Additional low-intensity parking areas are stabilized with gravel-grass.
        These flat surfaces are made of large bluestone gravel and seeded with
        native grasses. The combination absorbs stormwater quickly and is
        attractive and green when not in use.
      </p>
      <p>
        In combination with our Visitor &amp; Administration Building, LEED&reg;
        Platinum certified by the U.S. Green Building Council, and upcoming
        Sustainable Pathways project, QBG will be capable of diverting 95% of
        stormwater that falls on our 39 acres from the city's sewer system.
