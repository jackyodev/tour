        "An evergreen shrub native to western China. It was introduced into the southeastern U.S. where it has escaped gardens and naturalized from Maryland and Virginia south to Alabama and Florida. Fragrant yellow flowers in loose, spreading to pendant racemes (each to 3-6‚Äù long), bloom in late winter to early spring (February- April). Flowers are followed by ornamentally attractive, waxy green fruits which hang in grape-like clusters and mature to blue-black in late spring to early summer. Fruits are attractive to birds.",
